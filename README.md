# NBA Guessing Game

An interactive daily puzzle game where players guess NBA players based on hints about their team, conference, division, position, height, and age. Kinda like Wordle but for basketball fans!

## Key Features

- **Daily Challenge Mode**: A new mystery player every day that all players attempt to guess
- **Unlimited Practice Mode**: Play as many games as you want with random players
- **Visual Feedback System**: 
  - Green indicates a correct match
  - Yellow shows you're close (for height/age within a certain range)
  - Gray means the attribute doesn't match


## Notes

Fun to make, and fun to just play around with! Learned that Poeltl was a thing like halfway through this... 😔
Vercel is also very nice to work with; the abstraction + GitHub integration makes things very convenient. 
In the future, I'd like to add in some form of "Score" as well as other types of statistics.
